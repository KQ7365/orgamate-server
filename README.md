## Description

Research indicates that persistent disorganization can lead to increased stress levels and decreased overall well-being due to the cognitive burden associated with managing multiple, unstructured tasks and items (source: "Journal of Personality and Social Psychology"). However, OrgaMate effectively addresses this issue by offering a centralized platform for users to efficiently organize tasks and items. What sets OrgaMate apart is its unique customization feature, allowing users to set the location of an item, assign a category, and create and apply multiple tags for easy searchability. In a world that may feel chaotic, OrgaMate empowers users to regain control over a significant aspect of that chaos!

#### Description of the user type

The user of this application is any individual who needs to stay organize. The difference with Orgamate is the versatility the user is presented with. Users have many areas they can customize so any tasks can be managed and any item can be organized.
